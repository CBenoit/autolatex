----------------
1. PREREQUISITES
----------------

To install AutoLaTeX, you need to have Perl installed on your operating system.
We recommend also to have GNU Make installed. If not, you could copy/paste the
installation commands from the inside of the generated file named 'Makefile'.
Indeed, we provide a 'Makefile' because it is a common tool for compilation and
installation on Unix systems. The file 'Makefile' contains all the commands that
msut be executed to compile and install AutoLaTeX.

-------------------------
2. PREPARING INSTALLATION
-------------------------

a) Installing all the modules
-----------------------------

If you want to install all the modules provided by AutoLaTeX, type on a command line:

$ ./Makefile.PL

or:

$ ./Makefile.PL --prefix=<usr_path>

where <usr_path> is the path to the 'usr' root directory, eg. '/usr' or '/usr/local'
on Unix platforms, where AutoLaTeX should be installed.

The previous command creates the file 'Makefile'.
From this point, you could compile and install AutoLateX.

b) Installing some of the modules
-----------------------------

If you want to install only a part of the modules provided by AutoLaTeX, you must use
the command line options '--enable' or '--disable' followed by the name of a module.

The complete list of the modules may be obtained by:

$ ./Makefile.PL --modules


Let say you do not want to install the module 'gedit'.
You should type:

$ ./Makefile.PL --disable gedit

------------
3. COMPILING
------------

To compile AutoLaTeX, i.e. to generate the manual files..., you must type:

$ make all

or simply:

$ make

-------------
4. INSTALLING
-------------

a) Copying the files
--------------------

To install AutoLaTeX inside the directory given to 'Makefile.PL', you must type:

$ make install


b) Updating TeX database
------------------------

At this point, all the files where copied.
If you have installed the STY file provided by AutoLaTeX, you
must update the TeX database with the following commands:

$ mktexlsr
$ update-updmap --quiet


c) Updating Gsettings
---------------------

In order for GSettings to use the autolatex's schema, it was copied to the
'<usr_path>/share/glib-2.0/schemas/' directory and then that directory
should be compiled by glib-compile-schemas.
You must type the command:

$ glib-compile-schemas <usr_path>/share/glib-2.0/schemas/

where <usr_path> is the path to the 'usr' root directory, eg. '/usr' or '/usr/local'.


-----------
5. CLEANING
-----------

To remove the temprary files and the generated files, you must type:

$ make clean
